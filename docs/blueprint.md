## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft gold (#D4AF37) for an impression of understated luxury. Gold suggests high-end visual design work, creativity, and the California origins of the name 'Dream With Vision.'
- Background color: Very dark gray (#222222) to make the content stand out while also complementing the modern look and luxurious feel.
- Accent color: Slate Gray (#708090), which sits to the "left" of Gold on the color wheel and provides enough contrast for elements such as active menu states or hovered links.
- Font pairing: 'Playfair' (serif) for headings and short text, with 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text. Playfair gives an elegant, high-end feel while PT Sans gives a contemporary reading experience.
- Sections fill 100vh on all screens. Sticky top navigation.
- Minimal icons to improve UX for sections.
- Subtle animations when scrolling between sections.
